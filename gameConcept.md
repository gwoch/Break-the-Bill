synopsis 

find the key to get in the house without being killed by invisible (but noisy) demons. To do so you will have to solve an enigma but will be helped by a pair of magical glasses that make elements of the magic realm visible. 
But Once in the house you are still not safe. More demon and puzzles are stopping from escaping...this nightmare.
