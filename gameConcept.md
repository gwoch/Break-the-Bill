find the key to get in the house without being killed by invisible (but noisy) demons. To do so you will have to solve an enigma but will be helped by a pair of magical glasses that make elements of the magic realm visible. 
But Once in the house you are still not safe. More demon and puzzles are stopping from escaping...this nightmare.

//Lost in a maze, you hear a laugh. An invisible monster is cnstantly chasing you, and your only salvation is the house that is at the end of the maze. In order to get inside the house you will have to solve the puzzles spread around the area while you avoid the infatigable monster. As the monster is invisible, you need the help of a strange pair of glasses that you found at the begining of the maze, which have two different kinds of vision modes. With one, most of the secrets of the maze become visible. However, the only way to detect the monster and see it is to use the other vision mode, that will hide many of the objecs and secrets that you need to solve the puzzle and enter the house. What you don't know is that inside the house even more horros await for you.
