Introduction to project of creating something and having fun ??

Game Perspective Format 
1st Person Format (open to 3rd person if we have a rigged model we want to use).

Concept Ideas
1•	Escape Room : 
One or two room, objects to interact, puzzle game. Open for ideas on the theme of the room. 

2•	Runner game:
Running away from multiple enemies and can be open to idea of level design. 

3•	Mystery Game:
One room, object to interact, solve the mystery?

4•	You vs CPU:
Can create a simple board game to go against the CPU (chess/0 and Xs etc.)
One room, and objects to interact.

5•	Bullet Hell game:
Reach to the other side of room whilst Objects with different effect spawn to shoot you. Open to different theme.

6) Paint Game (puzzle/platformer):
You are trapped in the darkness, and you need to find your way by shooting ink/paint that will LIGHT up the way. If you put too much paint, you will be blinded by the light.

7) Tank Transform (3rd person):
You control a vehicle that can transform into a tank, a jet and a giant mech. Each form has an ability that is specific to it. The Tank can shoot, the plane can fly, the mech can pick stuff up/zoom.

8) Control 2 characters:
You control two different characters/objects. Both need to reach the end point if you wish to move on to the second level. The player must switch between the objects in order to solve the puzzles.

9) Binding of Isaac inspired game:
A recreate of the binding of Isaac, but the player can only shoot for a very limited amount of time, and in order properly manage his bullets, must draw on the touchpad to switch weapons.








1•	Escape Room concept ideas:
get in the house: lock outside, we are trying to get in before the sun sets. OWe can interact with objets scatered in the garden. some give us clues about a back story, others make us progress in solving the puzzle.
Like, its a magnetic door, electricity is off, where is the fuze box, where is the key for the box...
maybe if you go in a corner there is a character that give you clues but you can't be sure his is not lying. interactive sound design, music themes depending on where you are and what stage of the game you are or what object you areholding.
activate switches and levers - location + object (liek shining a torch light at a window).
