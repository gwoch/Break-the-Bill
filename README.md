Introduction to project of creating something and having fun

Game Perspective Format 
1st Person Format (open to 3rd person if we have a rigged model we want to use).

Concept Ideas
1•	Escape Room : 
One or two room, objects to interact, puzzle game. Open for ideas on the theme of the room. 

2•	Runner game:
Running away from multiple enemies and can be open to idea of level design. 

3•	Mystery Game:
One room, object to interact, solve the mystery?

4•	You vs CPU:
Can create a simple board game to go against the CPU (chess/0 and Xs etc.)
One room, and objects to interact.

5•	Bullet Hell game:
Reach to the other side of room whilst Objects with different effect spawn to shoot you. Open to different theme.

6) Paint Game (puzzle/platformer):
You are trapped in the darkness, and you need to find your way by shooting ink/paint that will LIGHT up the way. If you put too much paint, you will be blinded by the light.

7) Tank Transform (3rd person):
You control a vehicle that can transform into a tank, a jet and a giant mech. Each form has an ability that is specific to it. The Tank can shoot, the plane can fly, the mech can pick stuff up/zoom.

8) Control 2 characters:
You control two different characters/objects. Both need to reach the end point if you wish to move on to the second level. The player must switch between the objects in order to solve the puzzles.

9) Binding of Isaac inspired game:
A recreate of the binding of Isaac, but the player can only shoot for a very limited amount of time, and in order properly manage his bullets, must draw on the touchpad to switch weapons.

10) Paint game 2 
This is based off of Portal and Splatoon. In this game, the player cannot move left/right/forward/backward. He can only 'teleport' from one place to another by spraying paint in a specific area. Keeping in mind that the player has an extremely limited supply of paint, and if, for whatever reason, he leaves the area painted, he is paralyzed and cannot move.

11) Defenders Intersection
This is an FPS game, but the player does not fight holding a gun - in fact, he cannot fight at all. He can only defend himself from enemy attacks by using his two shields - each having a limited energy supply. In order to defeat his enemies, he must use his creativity (we'll also leave some pointers) to advance in the game. 

12) Spy game.
This is a 1rst POV game, where the player must sneak around the enemy base to complete a mission (retrieve information, etc.) and must not be killed. The player has a number of different skills that can be unlocked, but he or she is incapable of directly harming anyone (no guns, no knives, etc).

13•	Escape Room concept ideas:
get in the house: lock outside, we are trying to get in before the sun sets. OWe can interact with objets scatered in the garden. some give us clues about a back story, others make us progress in solving the puzzle.
Like, its a magnetic door, electricity is off, where is the fuze box, where is the key for the box...
maybe if you go in a corner there is a character that give you clues but you can't be sure his is not lying. interactive sound design, music themes depending on where you are and what stage of the game you are or what object you areholding.
activate switches and levers - location + object (liek shining a torch light at a window).



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
14• 3D glasses: This is kind of inspired in the paint game. Basically the character has a pair of speciall 3D glasses (the one with red and blue coloured glasses) that, when you use them and you look just thorugh one eye (for example, the one looking thrugh the red glass) you see all the room/environment in that colour and there are sme objects/actions that can only be seen/done when you look through one eye or the other. Basically we would have three modes, the blue mode, the red mode and a third mode when we have both eyes open, and we have to solve puzzles/the mystery using that.


15• Telekinetic prisoner: In this game the character is completely inmovilized, he/she/it is attatched to a kind of litter in a laboratory and has to scape using the objects in the room with his/her/its telekinetic power. It is impossible that the character moves in the entire game, so if you wanna move him, you have to move the litter/whatever he is attatched to.

Special effect or animation Ideas

Just cool little effect we could program that would make the level look cool.

a)	The entire room transforming into another room:
the room can break apart and flip into something completely different.

Good example: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1jyUAtxh-8
[Watch between 1:25 - 1:37 to see what I mean]

Open to a game idea where you as the player get chased by an entity and your only option is to run. Run down the hallways and to see the room changing right in front of you. Yout only salvation is a glowing light that you have to follow to avoid being consume by the darkness. This would a fast pace game.

b)	Force Field or the player surrounded by a mystical glow:
Possibly following from idea 6) a sphere shape around the player can help indicate lighting or where your paint gun will shoot.
c)	Gravity ride: 
Have the character move in some multiple phases of low and high gravity depend on which room you are in.
